# Building First Machine Learning Model 

- Starts by taking a data set and builiding a model on top of that 
- Data set contains data which is comprised of variables, so we gotta pick, which of those variables are essential in making a decision 
- We now clean the data by removing the missing values from the data
- After cleaning we segregate the data into subsets 


The following is the core process of what happens next: 
- Define: Define the model, what is the type of the model? 
- Fit: In this step, you'll be using the data to recognize the patterns that exist in it
- Predict: Using the above pattern, to predict a value
- Evaluate: Test if the predicted value is right or wrong
